# calendar
calendar test for alumni club site 


# Background
- i've been really disappointed with the way that the calendar is rendering in BayAreaJackets.org 
- my goal is just to have something where people can browse events within the landing page and sign up to subscribe to the calendar so they have it "sync" with their calendars. But they make it very hard and it appears this has not been updated since 2006 *sigh* 
- I played around with a module I could make myself but I'm still debating. It doesn't seem like it makes sense to do that for a volunteer position. 
- it looks OK right now but I wish there was a one click subscribe button that would let them subscribe to the calendar. Instead it's tricky. So right now I link to a google doc explaining to do it on a desktop even though 99.99 percent of people are going to use that on their phone. 

# Status
- I think i'll stick with google cal until it drives me sufficiently crazy 
- do you see how the UI isn't great and it's not ideal that it's going to a google doc (google doc is notoriously difficult to see on mobile). really wish there was something better. airtable rendered very well and looked nice but costs money to integrate with google cal. google cal seems best option for 3 co-leaders to all collaborate on planning events

- making this repo private because i accidentally uploaded keys and even though i've tried to totally remove them somehow apparently they're still out there and i'm getting bombarded by emails lol 
- well i guess i have to rotate the keys anyways so i'll keep it public but with new key. will be interesting to see if i keep getting the warning emails. how do i remove the keys from my history? it seems like a common mistake to forget to add it to the gitignore 


- also added restriction restricting it to the google cal api
